Editing the JS or CSS.


The CSS and JS are compliled using gulp.

CSS is compiled from the `sass` directory into the `CSS` directory
 
and js from `js/src` into `js/src/dist`

you can grab the src from there and import to hugo and use them as you wish.

or you have npm you can run `npm i` and `npm run gulp` to develop in this project and copy accross the result.


give me a shout if you have a questions.
